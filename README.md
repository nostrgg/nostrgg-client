**IMPORTANT: This library is not as useful anymore and will be deprecated. The features from this client have now almost all been integrated into [nostrl-tools](https://github.com/fiatjaf/nostr-tools) instead.<br><br> 
My efforts will now be focused on [nostr-react](https://github.com/t4t5/nostr-react), which uses `nostr-tools` under the hood!**

    "wss://nostr-relay.untethr.me",
  ],
  onConnect: (relayUrl, sendEvent) => {
    console.log("Nostr connected to:", relayUrl)

    // Send a REQ event to start listening to events from that relayer:
    sendEvent([SendMsgType.REQ, {
      filter: {
        kinds: [Kind.TextNote],
        since: 0, // All events since the dawn of time
      },
    }], relayUrl)
  },
  onEvent: (relayUrl, event) => {
